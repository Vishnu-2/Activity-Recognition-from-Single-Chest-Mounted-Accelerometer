# Activity-Recognition-from-Single-Chest-Mounted-Accelerometer
There are 15 participants who wore accelerator meter to collect data on various actions. The accelerator meter data contains x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, and label. Your task is to build a model that can classify an action based on the input accelerator meter data (x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration)
**Dataset Information**

   --- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest
   --- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz
   --- Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated
   --- Number of Participants: 15
   --- Number of Activities: 7
   --- Data Format: CSV

   --- Data are separated by participant
   --- Each file contains the following information
       ---- sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label 
   --- Labels are codified by numbers
       --- 1: Working at Computer
       --- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going up\down stairs
       --- 3: Standing
       --- 4: Walking	
       --- 5: Going Up\Down Stairs
       --- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone
       --- 7: Talking while Standing
